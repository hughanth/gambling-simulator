### Project intro

Gambling Simulator is a 3d game set in a casino. It will have a variety of casino games to play accompanied by a casino's bright and loud atmosphere. It is intended to bring the average person into the casino to feel the adrenalin of gambling with none of the risk. The game mechanics will be designed to be similar to how real casino games feel and play, all from the comfort of your home. With simple graphics to give it a nostalgic feel. 

### Team philosophy

The goal for our team this term is to create a fun, interactive, virtual casino. We will work together to the best of our abilities and help each other to ensure that our product is something that we all will be proud of and one that will bring entertainment to the customers conveniently wherever they may be. 

### Team roles/responsibilities

Roles and responsibilities: Each person will be assigned a part where their strengths can benefit them, and we'll all assist each other out to make sure everything works well together.

Adjusting workload in the future: We'll continuously regulate the work to make sure every member has a fair share. In case of a member joining or leaving, the parts will be adjusted again to have an equal workload.

New roles and Responsibilities: We'll meet to talk about new responsibilities and decide who can take on the new role and responsibility according to their workload and strengths. Having a large group provides an opportunity to delegate the work between multiple people if needed.

Provide a list of your team members and their initially assigned roles:  
 \- Daniel, Blackjack Game, Documentation  
 \- Spencer, Blackjack Game  
 \- Oleksii \- Slots Game, Lead Developer  
 \- Hugh, Slots Game, QA / Testing  
 \- Liam,  Craps  
 \- Tim, Craps  
 \- Ozan, UI / UX Design  
 \- Josiah, Team Lead, 3D environment

### Planned team meeting time(s) and communication plans

Outside of the scheduled lab block the team will be communicating primarily through discord. Weâ€™ve created a group chat with all team members and have identified that *Tuesday afternoons* work best for all of us to meet virtually via. audio and have discussions outside of the lab time. 

We will communicate in advance the main topics that need to be discussed so each member can come prepared to the meetings. The text chat within the group will allow us to keep in touch between our meetings and make sure we are all on track and on the same page.

If a group member is unable to attend a scheduled meeting, it is encouraged they give as much notice as possible so the rest of the group can prepare as needed. As a group we can post a brief summary of the meeting over the text chat.

### Deadlines and deliverables

Each person will be responsible for completing their tasks, as described in the tuesday and friday meetings. The team lead will be responsible for keeping track of what projects need extra hands. At our scheduled meetings the team will discuss our progress towards our weekly goals.

### Conflict resolution scheme

Our team will try to resolve conflicts internally. If there is a conflict between two people they will try to resolve it by themselves. If the problem continues to persist however then our group members will be able to consult the team lead or the group as a larger whole.

### Team AI policies

Members of the team have come to the agreement that some AI use is ok but to not use it to fully do the work. Some acceptable uses include searching for ideas and helpful coding tips. Unacceptable uses include directly copying and pasting code from AI and having it do your work.

### Discussion of team strengths/weaknesses

Strengths

- We have a large group: A bigger team allows us to divide tasks efficiently, bringing diverse ideas and speeding up the development process.  
- Lots of coding experience between us: Our strong programming skills ensure that the technical aspects of the game, like mechanics and functionality, will be well-handled.

Weaknesses

- Organization of a big group will be difficult: Managing and coordinating a large team may lead to communication issues and inefficiencies.  
- Little game development experience: While we can code, most of us are unfamiliar with game design principles, which could slow down development.Not many people have experience with art: The lack of artistic skills could make it challenging to create engaging visuals and assets for the game.
